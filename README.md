# Password Generator

A beginner Python script for generating secure, random passwords based on user defined lengths.

## Features:
- Fully randomised password generation using the 'random' module
- Customisable password lengths
- Includes letters, digits and special characters
- Option to save passwords to a new or existing .txt file
- Passwords saved with useage context (e.g. Email, GitHub)

## Future improvements:
- Add scoring system to rate password strength
- Integrate clipboard copy features
- Encrypt saved passwords

## How to use:
- python password_generator.py
- Follow prompts to choose password use, set desired password length, choose whether to save and where to save it

## What I learned:
- Using Python for practical security tools
- File handling and conditional logic
- Creating a clean user experience though input validation
